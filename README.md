# autosat
Just a silly thing for myself to auto record Meteor M2 3/4 with SDR++ and Satdump
Put autosat into /usr/bin/

Need SDR++ and satdump installed!

INSTRUCTIONS:
: Setup SDR++'s recording directory
: run autosat
: Record a pass on SDR++
: Close SDR++
Output is in SDR++ recording directory (ex: Nov-03-04H35M/ )
